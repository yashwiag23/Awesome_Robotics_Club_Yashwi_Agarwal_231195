Include the LiquidCrystal library to control LCD and define pin numbers for various components. Parameters of object lcd specify the pins to which display is connected. Define the custom graphics for bird and obstacles. Initialize the LCD display. Draw the bird at a certain distance and also display the distance covered. 'setup' function initializes pin modes for the components and calls initializeGraphics(). The main 'loop' function displays 'Press start' till the button is pushed if the game is being played, updates distance travelled and checks for collisions then prints 'Game Over'. 'buttonPush' function sets the variable to true when the button is pushed.
