Gyrobot: I really loved the concept of a self-balancing robot, because it seems very counter-intuitive. Even bicycles seem weird when you think about it, but once we understand it, we know it's based on basic physics concepts. This is exactly what excites me about this project. The fact that we can use well-known physics concepts, combined with our knowledge of coding, circuits and mechanical design, to build a self-balancing robot is extremely fascinating.
Space Station Controls and Communication: I am really interested in learning the ideas and applications of ROS and Zigbee, since these are completely new to me and I'm curious to explore them. I have learnt basics of PID Control in the EEA Winter Project and am excited to be able to use it further in this project.
